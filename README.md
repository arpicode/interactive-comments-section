## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
-   Upvote and downvote comments
-   **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
-   **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

### TODOs

This is a first version that meets the requirements of the challenge + bonuses. I will probably continue working on some features:

-   Keyboard navigation for better accessibility
-   Finish animations (like when deleting a message)
-   Some refactoring
